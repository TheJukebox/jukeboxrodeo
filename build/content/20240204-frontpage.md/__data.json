I settled on writing this with \u003Ca href=\"https://svelte.dev/\">Svelte\u003C/a>, which I found very approachable as far as web frameworks go. Usually I find myself a bit paralyzed by the amount of options I see for web, especially when it comes time to actually make something happen and I have to research an implementation. It seems like there are so many ways to skin this cat (or \u003Ca href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/csS/css_align.asp\">align an element\u003C/a>), remembering the right one turns into a painful exercise very quickly where my div is all of a sudden skinning me instead.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As part of a push this year to work more on personal projects, I'll be throwing up changes to this site over at \u003Ca href=\"https://gitlab.com/the_jukebox/jukeblog\">GitLab\u003C/a>. The plan is to build a pipeline, so all I do is write markdown content and it gets pushed to where it needs to go and then displayed without any manual interference from my grubby human hands. I figure the further I take this into familiar territory (CI/CD, sprinkle on some Python and some bash, do some fancy GitOps stuff), the more likely I am to actually produce web content I'm proud of.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I want to write things and post them here, but that will all be tied into a blogging feature I want to write. I want it to be frictionless, so I can just write a markdown file on any of my machines and get it up here with a quick review process. That's probably my first piece of written content outside of this intro, now that I think about it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>good luck!\u003Cbr>\n-- jukebox\u003C/p>\n","20240204-frontpage.md"],"uses":{"params":["post"]}}]}
