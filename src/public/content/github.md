# Moving to GitHub

After some very frustrating experiences with GitLab
in anger, I've moved to GitHub (and sometimes Gitea).

As part of that, I figured I'd try moving this site into
GitHub pages, rather than hosting it over at DigitalOcean.
That means I had to build it as a static site, which wasn't
all that tricky given the content is just a bunch of markdown
files.

If I have a plan to make content change live, I'll have to work
on that, but it doesn't really matter for now.

You can check out [](https://github.com/thejukebox/) for
whatever projects I've pushed!
