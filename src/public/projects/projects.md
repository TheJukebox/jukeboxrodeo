I have a few plates spinning, mostly for fun.

## Lute

Lute is intended to be an open-source, self-hosted streaming platform, specifically for audio. It spawned from online D&D sessions, where we always had a hard time finding a place to listen to music together consistently. Platforms that sync YouTube streams are frustrating, because sometimes content is blocked, ads play, or embeds just stop working. Instead, we figured why not build a little web radio-esque tool?

It's still in early stages and everyone is pretty busy, but there's progress being made. You can find the Lute repository [here](https://gitlab.com/lute-dev/lute).

## Vulkan

I'm working my way through a [Vulkan tutorial]() to learn some low-level graphics rendering. There aren't many things you do in software that give you such an immediate visual response (and bugs look funny).

You can check out my progress [here](https://gitlab.com/the_jukebox/learn-vulkan).

## jukebox.rodeo

This website is built with Svelte. I don't normally go near web, so it's pretty primitive.

You can find the source for it [here](https://gitlab.com/the_jukebox/jukeblog).

## Terabyte Cowboy

I make music, usually with synths and eurorack modules ([VCV rack is really cool, you should check it out](https://vcvrack.com/)), under the name Terabyte Cowboy. I have a [bandcamp](https://terabytecowboy.bandcamp.com/) where it goes up for free but it's also pay-what-you-want if you think it's worth cash.
