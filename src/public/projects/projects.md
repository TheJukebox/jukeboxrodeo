I have a few plates spinning.

## reputablebot - [repo](https://github.com/thejukebox/reputable_bot)

reputablebot is a Discord bot I maintain for my server. It's integrated with
[Ollama](https://ollama.com), so its pretty easy to self-host! You can (sorta)
have it run a generated RPG for you, which is a crowd favourite.

## Lute - [repo](https://github.com/thejukebox/lute)

Lute is intended to be an open-source, self-hosted streaming platform, specifically
for audio. It spawned from online D&D sessions, where we always had a hard time
finding a place to listen to music together consistently. Platforms that sync YouTube
streams are frustrating, because sometimes content is blocked, ads play, or embeds
just stop working. Instead, we figured why not build a little web radio-esque tool?

It's still in early stages and everyone is pretty busy, but there's progress
being made. You can find the Lute repository [here](https://github.com/thejukebox/lute).

## jukebox.rodeo - [repo](https://github.com/thejukebox/jukeboxrodeo)

This website is built with Svelte. I don't normally go near web, so it's pretty primitive.

You can find the source for it [here](https://github.com/thejukebox/jukeboxrodeo).

## Terabyte Cowboy - [bandcamp](https://terabytecowboy.bandcamp.com/)

I make music, usually with synths and eurorack modules
([VCV rack is really cool, you should check it out](https://vcvrack.com/)),
under the name Terabyte Cowboy. I have a
[bandcamp](https://terabytecowboy.bandcamp.com/) where it goes up for free
but it's also pay-what-you-want if you think it's worth cash.
